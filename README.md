# measurement-of-physiological-parameters-using-computer-vision

This project deals with the implementation of a methodology for measurement of heart 
rate and respiratory rate. First, we locate the areas of the chest and 
face and then based on their movement we extract the necessary data. Upon temporal 
filtering of data and using primary components we end up with an estimation of  heart 
and respiratory rate. Finally, the proposed methodology is evaluated for its accuracy 
and usability. This is achieved after comparing the results with a "smart" watch and 
with  an  application  of  a  "smart"  mobile  phone.  Both  methods  are  based  on 
photoplethysmography.
